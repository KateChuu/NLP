You should also **lowercase the words**. Finally, randomly shuffle (`numpy.random.shuffle`) this collection of word types, and split them into disjoint training and testing sets. The test set should contain 1000 word types, and the rest should be in the  training set. Note that we are intentionally making the hangman game hard, as the AI will need to cope with test words that it has not seen before, hence it will need to learn generalisable patterns of characters to make reasonable predictions.\n",

    "**Instructions:** The length of the secret word is an important clue that we might exploit. Different lengths tend to have different distributions over characters, e.g., short words are less likely to have suffixes or prefixes. You should incorporate this idea by conditioning the unigram model on the length of the secret word, i.e.,  having a **different unigram model for each length**. You will need to be a little careful at test time, to be robust to the situation that you encounter a word length that you didn't see in training. In such a case, your method should behave like the previous `unigram_guesser` in Question 3 (i.e., it guesses characters based on unigram frequencies, unconditioned by the word length).\n",

    "**Instructions:** Now for the next challenge, you'll build a **bigram language model** over characters. The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task here is to develop a bigram language model over characters, and train it over the training words. Remember to be careful when handling the start of each word properly, e.g., by padding with a special starting symbol such as `$`. Do we also need a special ending symbol? That's for you to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your bigram guesser should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using its left context character. For example, in the partial word `e _ c _ b _ _` we know the left context for the first three blanks, but have no known left context for the last blank. In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model). You should sum up the probability distribution (over all alphabets from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>) for the 4 blanks, and select the alphabet with the highest probability that hasn't been guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "- When backing-off to the unigram language model, you **must use the vanilla unigram language model that you have built in Q3**. Do not use the length-based unigram language model, or any fancy variant, or you will lose marks.\n",
    "- You should build a **standard bigram language model**; i.e. do not do anything complicated like a bidirectional bigram language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Collect frequency counts that are necessary for building a bigram language model and store them in bigram_counts; feel free to add new objects if needed (use the first answer space). Complete the `bigram_guesser` method (use the second answer space). Note that the method currently only has one additional argument (`bigram_counts`), but you are free to add additional arguments."

    "I implemented several techniques to improve the hangman AI's performance. \n",

    "- **Add-k smoothing**: I applied add-k smoothing when computing bigram and CBOW probabilities. Only the unigram model sees all characters in training. Other models like bigram or CBOW models don't know how to handle unseen character combinations like `\"xr\"` or `\"zx\"` when testing. Therefore, smoothing is essential. I experimented with k values from 1 to 0.005 and found smaller values yielded marginally better results generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bidirectional bigram**: To improve contextual understanding, I incorporated a bidirectional bigram model and pad the word with a period `.` at the end. Unlike the normal bigram which looks left-to-right, the reversed bigram tracks characters that precede a given letter. For instance, after seeing `\"ea\"`, `\"ra\"`, `\"ta\"` and `\"ta\"`, it stores the counts as `{'a': {'e': 1, 'r': 1, 't': 2}}`. This boosted performance by about 0.5 fewer mistakes on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CBOW**: Unlike bigram models, CBOW takes into account both side of the middle characters at the same time. Initially, I used a window of size 3 and let's say, the model sees `'cat'` during training, it records `{('c','t'): {'a':1}}`. This helped the model in the later stages of guessing, reducing errors from 8.3 to around 7.7. Extending the window to size 5 further improved accuracy to nearly 7.5. However, a window of 7 worsened performance to roughly 8.9 mistakes, probably because such wide contexts were too specific and didn’t generalize well. Moreover, Some words are shorter than 7 letters after padding, and even longer ones might not provide consistent patterns across training and test sets. Note that if a word satisfies the conditions of CBOW with both window sizes, the model calculates probabilities twice using different window sizes. I made this design decision because there are lots of unseen 5-grams, so the probabilities computed according to CBOW with a window size of 5 may not be beneficial sometimes, requiring the assistance of CBOW with a smaller window size."
